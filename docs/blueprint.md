## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Vivid red (#FF0000) to dominate the cyberpunk aesthetic.
- Background color: Black or dark gray (#333333) for contrast and readability.
- Accent color: Cyan (#00FFFF) to highlight interactive elements and CTAs.
- Headline font: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for a modern, computerized feel. Body font: 'Inter' (sans-serif).
- Use vector-based icons with a neon or wireframe style, predominantly in red and cyan.
- Layout emulates a code editor, utilizing panels, and a monospaced font. Includes faux 'command-line' input areas.
- Incorporate glitch effects and subtle flickering animations to enhance the cyberpunk feel. Content should appear with cyberpunk-style animations on scroll.
